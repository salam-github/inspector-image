## Image Comparison

The Image Inspector tool includes a sophisticated image comparison feature, designed to analyze and identify differences between two images. This capability is invaluable for spotting modifications, tracking changes over time, or confirming the uniqueness of images.

### Behind the Scenes: The Comparison Logic

At the core of the comparison feature is the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), a method for measuring the similarity between two images. Unlike simpler comparison metrics that might only analyze pixel-by-pixel differences, SSIM considers changes in texture, luminance, and contrast, offering a more nuanced and human-perception-aligned evaluation.

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Load Images:** Initially, the tool loads both images into memory to prepare them for analysis.

2. **Grayscale Conversion:** To focus on structural differences without the distraction of color, both images are converted to grayscale. This step simplifies the data and emphasizes the aspects most relevant to human visual perception.

3. **SSIM Calculation:** The tool calculates the SSIM score between the two grayscale images. The SSIM index is a decimal value ranging between -1 and 1, where 1 signifies perfect similarity. This score quantitatively expresses how similar the two images are from a structural standpoint.

4. **Highlighting Differences:** Once the SSIM calculation identifies discrepancies, the tool amplifies these differences. It does so by thresholding the difference image to isolate the distinct areas and then drawing contours around these regions on one of the original images. This process effectively highlights where the images diverge.

#### The Mathematics of SSIM:

The SSIM index is calculated using a formula that incorporates three comparison measurements: luminance, contrast, and structure. Each measurement compares corresponding elements of the two images (e.g., pixel values) to evaluate their similarity. The final SSIM score is a combination of these three metrics, providing a comprehensive assessment of similarity.

### Visualizing the Differences:

The GUI presents a triptych view for comparison:

- **Original Images Side-by-Side:** This allows for a direct visual comparison, helping users to spot differences manually.

- **Highlighted Differences:** A third pane shows one of the original images with discrepancies outlined, making it easier to identify specific areas of change.

### Utilizing the Comparison Feature:

To use this feature within the GUI:

1. Select the primary image through the "Select Image" button.
2. Initiate the comparison by clicking "Compare Images," which prompts you to choose the second image.
3. Upon selection, the tool processes the images and displays the comparative analysis, including the SSIM score and the visual highlights of differences.
